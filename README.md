# Nebula
A variable architecture education tool for testing programs against different aspects of CPU architectures. 

This is a spiritual successor to [Cosmic](https://github.com/clbx/Cosmic) but is a more useful and less esoteric tool. 

Unlike Cosmic, Nebula does not implement its own machine language and instead uses the MIPS I instruction set due to its simplicity and prevelence in education. The goal of this project is not to be a feature rich simulator, but instead to simulate how different aspects of basic CPU architecture interact with one another. This being said, I'm not fully confident that this will ever run any amount of commerical or otherwise available MIPS binaries. 


This tool was inspired by and may be partially modeled off of SESC and my hatred on how little I know how to use it/how difficult it is to use and how little insight it gives to cycle to cyle action.
